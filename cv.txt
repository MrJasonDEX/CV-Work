Motivated and adaptable professional with hands-on and digital experience across IT, events, logistics, and hospitality. I've led digital projects, coordinated teams at large venues, and built confidence in tools like HTML, CSS, and Adobe Creative Cloud. I bring a practical mindset, strong problem-solving skills, and a solid work ethic to every role. Currently seeking a full-time opportunity — ideally in IT or digital — but open to any role where reliability, initiative, and adaptability are valued.
